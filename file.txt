Quick checklist — webhook auto-trigger (step by step)

Confirm job & Jenkinsfile

Jenkins job uses Pipeline script from SCM.

Repo URL correct, Branch set to */main (or your branch).

Script Path = Jenkinsfile.

Manual Build Now works and finishes SUCCESS.

Make Jenkins reachable from GitHub

If Jenkins is already public (not localhost) → great (use that URL).

If Jenkins is on your laptop → run ngrok:

ngrok http 8081


→ copy the https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.app URL shown under Forwarding.

Set Jenkins' public URL (one-time)

Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Jenkins URL

Paste the public URL (ngrok or college public URL). Include trailing slash.
Example: https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/

Save.

Enable GitHub trigger on the Jenkins job

Job → Configure → Build Triggers

Tick: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

Save.

Add Webhook in GitHub

GitHub → your repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook

Payload URL:
<JENKINS_PUBLIC_URL>/github-webhook/
Example: https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/github-webhook/

Content type: application/json

Events: Choose Just the push event

Click Add webhook.

Test: push a tiny change

Edit README.md (or any file) in the repo → add a line → commit & push to main.

Wait a few seconds.

Verify on Jenkins

Job page: new build should appear automatically.

Console Output should start with:
Started by GitHub push

Confirm pipeline runs the stages and finishes SUCCESS.

If it doesn’t trigger — quick checks (in order)

In GitHub → Webhooks → click your webhook → Recent Deliveries:

Status 200 = success.

Other code (4xx/5xx) → click payload response to see error.

In Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Jenkins URL must match the base used in webhook.

Job → Configure → Branch Specifier must match branch you pushed (*/main).

If your repo is private: ensure Jenkins has Git credentials (Add in job SCM → Credentials).

If GitHub shows delivery but Jenkins rejects: check Jenkins System Log for incoming webhook errors.

If using ngrok: make sure ngrok is running during the push (tunnel must be active).

Extra helpful checks

In Jenkins job Console Output, if it shows fatal: couldn't find remote ref refs/heads/master → change checkout to branch: 'main' in Jenkinsfile.

If webhook shows 403/forbidden → check any network/firewall or authentication requirement on the Jenkins server.

Minimal commands you might need locally
# start ngrok (if using local Jenkins)
ngrok http 8081

# test a push (locally)
git add README.md
git commit -m "webhook test"
git push origin main
