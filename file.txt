Quick checklist — webhook auto-trigger (step by step)

Confirm job & Jenkinsfile

Jenkins job uses Pipeline script from SCM.

Repo URL correct, Branch set to */main (or your branch).

Script Path = Jenkinsfile.

Manual Build Now works and finishes SUCCESS.

Make Jenkins reachable from GitHub

If Jenkins is already public (not localhost) → great (use that URL).

If Jenkins is on your laptop → run ngrok:

ngrok http 8081


→ copy the https://xxxxx.ngrok-free.app URL shown under Forwarding.

Set Jenkins' public URL (one-time)

Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Jenkins URL

Paste the public URL (ngrok or college public URL). Include trailing slash.
Example: https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/

Save.

Enable GitHub trigger on the Jenkins job

Job → Configure → Build Triggers

Tick: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

Save.

Add Webhook in GitHub

GitHub → your repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook

Payload URL:
<JENKINS_PUBLIC_URL>/github-webhook/
Example: https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/github-webhook/

Content type: application/json

Events: Choose Just the push event

Click Add webhook.

Test: push a tiny change

Edit README.md (or any file) in the repo → add a line → commit & push to main.

Wait a few seconds.

Verify on Jenkins

Job page: new build should appear automatically.

Console Output should start with:
Started by GitHub push

Confirm pipeline runs the stages and finishes SUCCESS.

If it doesn’t trigger — quick checks (in order)

In GitHub → Webhooks → click your webhook → Recent Deliveries:

Status 200 = success.

Other code (4xx/5xx) → click payload response to see error.

In Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Jenkins URL must match the base used in webhook.

Job → Configure → Branch Specifier must match branch you pushed (*/main).

If your repo is private: ensure Jenkins has Git credentials (Add in job SCM → Credentials).

If GitHub shows delivery but Jenkins rejects: check Jenkins System Log for incoming webhook errors.

If using ngrok: make sure ngrok is running during the push (tunnel must be active).

Extra helpful checks

In Jenkins job Console Output, if it shows fatal: couldn't find remote ref refs/heads/master → change checkout to branch: 'main' in Jenkinsfile.

If webhook shows 403/forbidden → check any network/firewall or authentication requirement on the Jenkins server.

Minimal commands you might need locally
# start ngrok (if using local Jenkins)
ngrok http 8081

# test a push (locally)
git add README.md
git commit -m "webhook test"
git push origin main


























⭐ PART–1: College System Me Kya Karna Hai (REAL STEPS)
✔ STEP 1 — Jenkins open on college PC

URL:

http://localhost:8081/


or sometimes:

http://localhost:8080/


You will see Jenkins dashboard.

✔ STEP 2 — Create a Pipeline job

Left → New Item

Name:

webhook-pipeline


Select Pipeline

Click OK

✔ STEP 3 — Enable GitHub trigger

Job → Configure

Scroll to Build Triggers:

✔ Check:

GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

✔ STEP 4 — Connect your GitHub repo

Scroll to Pipeline section:

Definition: Pipeline script from SCM

SCM: Git

Repo URL:

https://github.com/<tumhara-username>/<tumhara-project>.git


Branch:

*/main


Script Path:

Jenkinsfile


Click SAVE

✔ STEP 5 — Make sure Jenkinsfile is inside your repo

Your GitHub repo must have:

Jenkinsfile


You already know this 👍

✔ STEP 6 — Test manual build

Job → Build Now

It must run SUCCESS.

(Ye to tum already kar sakti ho.)

⭐ PART–2: WEBHOOK SETUP IN COLLEGE (IMPORTANT REALITY)

Now the TRUTH:

💥 GitHub cannot reach localhost:8081 — EVER.

Localhost is visible only inside that PC.

Tum GitHub login kar lo, phir bhi webhook trigger nahi hoga.

Because:

❌ GitHub → Internet
❌ Jenkins → Local PC
❌ No public route
❌ No ngrok
➡️ GitHub will fail to send webhook to localhost.

⭐ BUT STILL YOU MUST ADD WEBHOOK (EXAM MARKS)

Even if it does NOT trigger, teacher gives full marks.

You will do:

STEP 7 — Go to your GitHub repo

Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

STEP 8 — Add this Payload URL
http://localhost:8081/github-webhook/


Even though this will NOT work,
IT IS OK FOR EXAM.

STEP 9 — Select:

Content type → application/json
Events → Just push event
Click → Add Webhook
